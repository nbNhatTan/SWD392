# Libary Manager - FPTLibary


## Case study

The library management system of FPT University HCM was born to replace the previous library management system of FPT University. This system includes a basic library management system 
and is developed in direct operation on the Internet with tools to support online book ordering to facilitate the work of borrowing, returning books, creating announcements, and checking violation 
tickets.

## Software Product Vision

For FPT library staff, the staff wanted a new system that could take care of the basic tasks of the library as well as help them simplify in reducing the number of students queuing up to order books 
as easy management and notification of booking tickets. They wanted a web application that could help them to allow students to pre-order books and notify which books were out, reducing the number of students that had to go to the library while all the desired books were booked. On the 
other hand, they also want the new system to be able to manage tickets and send notifications automatically instead of the traditional Mail method, as well as help students track return deadlines and violations.

For FPT University students, they want the library to have a system that allows them to see the number of books remaining as well as to be able to pre-order the books they want. They also hope the school has a website that can let them track their order history.

This library management system was born in order to realise the above requirements to meet the needs of students and the school's management for the library of FPT University in Ho Chi Minh City.
